SHORT DESCRIPTION
	Describes the semantics of server.json.


LONG DESCRIPTION
	You can create a file called server.json inside the folder being served
	by PWebServer. This file follows JSON syntax and is used to
	configure advanced parameters of the server.

	For a description of the JSON syntax, see:

	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON
	http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf



	There is support for the following properties:

		{
			"redirect": {},
			"mapping": {},
			"relay": {},
			"hosts": {}
		}

	1.	Use the property "redirect" to make the server respond the request with http status 308 (permanent redirect).
		This can be used if your site is hosted inside a subfolder, but you still want the users to be able to access it without typing the subpath.
		For example: 'localhost:8080/' redirects to 'localhost:8080/mysite/'
		The property key is a regex match pattern and the value is a regex replace pattern.

		"redirect": {
			"^/$": "/mysite/"
		}


	2.	Use the property "mapping" to configure paths to resources that are not in the disk with the same name specified in the request.
		For example, you can specify that the file /css/style.css is actually /css/style.min.css.
		These mappings only apply if the server cannot find a particular static resource (in the given example, only if /css/style.css does not exist).
		The property key is a regex match pattern and the value is a regex replace pattern.

		"mapping": {
			"^/css/(.*).css$": "/css/$1.min.css",
			"^/js/(.*).js$": "/js/$1.min.js",
		}

		You shouldn't switch folders here, because the browser wouldn't know about the path change and that can cause problems with the url referrer.
		To change subpaths in your static server, use the redirect section.


	3.	Use the property "relay" to define url redirections to other servers.

		"relay": {
			"/somedatabase": "myBackendServer"
		}

		If a client makes any request starting with "/somedatabase", for example, a resource at "/somedatabase/get?what=stuff",
		the server will forward the request to "myBackendServer", which is defined in the "hosts" section.

	4.	Use the "hosts" section to define backend servers for the "relay" section.

		"hosts": {
			"myBackendServer": {
				"protocol": "http",
				"host": "my.backend2.com",
				"port": 80
			}
		}
